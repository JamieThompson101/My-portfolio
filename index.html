    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>The reason as to why I wanted to become a fullstack web developer is because I found the idea of coding, creating websites, and interacting more with websites piqued my interests. I enjoy reading, playing video games, and hiking in my free time. In the future, I hopes to work on even bigger, more riveting projects to hone my skills and become a better developer.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Some of the projects that I've worked on include editing and deploying this website as shown in this photo. I am currently working on building websites from scratch and to hone my skills with HTML and CSS.</p>

    <!-- add an image of a mod or something --> 
    <p>For my future projects, I would like to work on modding games such as Minecraft with my elder brother who is also a developer and creating a website about ai and the concept of "hallucination" for my own curiosity. In additon to this, I am already working on a commission for one of my online friends and will also be making a commissions page to link to my portfolio.</p>
