    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>The reason as to why Jamie wanted to become a fullstack web developer is because she found the idea of coding, creating websites, and interacting more with websites piqued her interests. She enjoys reading, playing video games, and hiking in her free time. In the future, Jamie hopes to work on even bigger, more riveting projects to hone her skills and become a better developer.</p></p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Some of the projects that I've worked on include editing and deploying this website as shown in this photo. I am currently working on building websites from scratch and to hone my skills with HTML and CSS.</p>

    <!-- add an image of a mod or something --> 
    <p>For my future projects, I would like to work on modding games such as Minecraft with my elder brother who is also a developer and creating a website about ai and the concept of "hallucination" for my own curiosity.</p>
