    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>The reason as to why Jamie wanted to become a fullstack web developer is because she found the idea of coding, creating websites, and interacting more with websites piqued her interests. She enjoys reading, playing video games, and hiking in her free time. In the future, Jamie hopes to work on even bigger, more riveting projects to hone her skills and become a better developer.</p>
